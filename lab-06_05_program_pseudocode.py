# Think about a task that you want to accomplish using programming
# Maybe you want to automate something you do every day on your computer?
# Break down some of the steps you can think of and write them in
# this file as pseudocode.
# You can come back and update this file when you've learned more.
# You can also add real Python code after learning the necessary concepts.
# For now, just practice breaking larger tasks into smaller steps
# and writing out your thoughts in pseudocode.

# A logging script to keep track of my 590 mining eth.
# Track minimum and maximum mining rate, highest difficulty of share,
# the amount mined each day and averages for different lengths of time.

# Check mining pool every ten minutes (or whatever the update rate is) and pull hashrate and current balance.
# Write information to a log.

# Pull highest share difficulty from mining program log and write it to log.

# Pull data from new log and format it on a site I can check.
# Show highest hash rate from the last week, highest ever.  Averages over last day, week, month.
# Find which hours of the day result in highest and lowest averages.
# Show current balance, actual daily average, weekly, monthly.
