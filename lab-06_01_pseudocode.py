# Your cat just had kittens! Now you want to put up an ad to give them
# to your friends. You'll need to save all names of the kittens,
# confirm that they each of them is cute, and show a message that
# that kitten is ready for adoption.
#
# Break this task up into a couple of steps of pseudocode
# and write the pseudocode below in code comments.
# You don't need to write any functional code, just map out the steps.

# Give each kitten a cute value from yes to extremely

# Send out a message to my friends that each kitten is cute

# Update the message whenever a kitten is adopted
